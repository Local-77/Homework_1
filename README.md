# The History of Apple and AI 
 

## How one of the biggest tech giants is making strides in development of NLP and machine learning for everyday use 

* Apple 
 

* Apple was incorporated on January 3rd, 1977, though their first computer, later known as the Apple I was finished in march of 1976.  

* Apple was founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who had been business partners since the fall of 1971 
 

* Steve Wozniak in March of 1976 had finished a HomeBrew computer using a chip manufactured by MOS. Upon showing this to Steve, Steve found immense commercial power in the computer and wanted to move it to market. For the purposes of this case study, we’ll move forward in time after apple had been in the marked for decades, with the commercial launch of Siri in 2011. Siri came about as a spin-off of a project by another company called SRI International, a non-profit AI development center. Though Siri as a tool wasn’t released until September of 2011, the concept of virtual assistants has been on the back burner for Apple as far back as 1987 with their video “Knowledge Navigator,” which depicted a man interacting with a virtual assistant, not unlike the virtual assistants seen in households today, giving various requests such as creating reminders, placing calls, or retrieving articles.  

* After the company was founded, the two Steve's went back and forth with several different individuals from different companies asking for investments, but utimately received an offer from Mike Markkula, who worked for Fairchild Semiconductor, as an angel investor. Now, Apple's most recent investors are Berkshire Hathaway and KB Securities.

## Business Activities: 
 

* As a business primarily selling consumer products, Apple isn't so much in the "problem solving" business these days as much as it is a "quality of life" business. I believe that has always been the motive for progress according to Apple, as they've implemented machine learning and NLP over the years as an attempt to add convenience to people's everyday lives. These range anywhere from automating everyday tasks like creating reminders, calling a family member, asking Siri to roll a D20 or perform simple math, all the way to using machine learning to optimize device performance and learn behaviors to suggest map directions based on time and location, or media sharing based on who's in it, where it was, and whether you have their contact information.
 

* The company's intended customer is everyone, really. Apple is always making an attempt to create technology that is accessible to more and more people every year. As far as solutions Apple owns that their competitors do not is an unparalleled ecosystem of products that communicate with each other fluidly. Other companies like microsoft or samsung are developing technologies, or allow use of third parties, to try to achieve the streamlined suite that Apple offers, but Apple's ecosystem and could based communication between devices is unmatched.
 

* A lot of the technologies they're using recently are machine learning and speech recognition. According to their Machine Learning Research blog, their most recent publications include mentions of 'Nearest Neighbour Phrase Mining' to improve speech recognition. Other notable research indicates 'improved speech recognition for people who stutter.' It seems their biggest focus now is using machine learning to improve NLP models like siri and other voice assistants.
 

## Landscape: 
 

* Consumer electronics
 

* The last 5-10 years have seen innovations to things such as facial recognition, improved voice assistants, as well as using AI to improve the camera software in phones.
 

* Other major companies include Samsung, Google and Amazon. All are making strides in their NLP development with their voice assistants.
 

## Results 
 

* Apple's progress in AI and Machine Learning, especially with projects like Siri has helped slingshot the commercial availability of personal assistants, creating new benchmarks for cloud communication technology and industry standards for what technology should be included with a consumer device.
 

* According to an article on Medium.com, two core metrics used to track progress in the NLP or ML sphere are "1. Intrinsic Evaluation: Focuses on intermediary objectives (i.e. the performance of an NLP component on a defined subtask) and 2. Extrinsic Evaluation: Focuses on the performance of the final objective (i.e. the performance of the component on the complete application) 

With these metrics in mind, I believe that in the general sense of NLP models with a UI, like Siri, there haven't been too many real advancements in a few years from Apple. Things like ChatGPT are making strides in the NLP scene, and what their models are capable of (on a free scale, not to mention the paid scale) far surpass the abilities Siri has. I do believe that the actual research Apple is conducting on NLP and ML is overall beneficial for the project as a whole. Their blog, machinelearning.apple.com, has incredible resources with different research areas, venues, and all sorts of different relevant topics on the progress being made in the AI space. 

* As far as their competitors go, google has obviously made good strides in their AI performance, especially with its new beta for Google AI. Samsung has available research, though it doesn't seem to be at the same scope of research Apple has available, but from a commerically available AI assistand standpoint, the only one that even comes close to Siri would be Alexa.
 

## Recommendations 
 

* My honest opinion, Apple can make great improvements to Siri. I still find myself rarely using Siri due mostly in part to the fact that you can't string questions together very naturally. Follow up could use improvements, as well as the general ability to have a legitimate conversation with the assistant would make siri a much more useful tool. 
 

* Having these adjustments to Siri would make it better simply by the fact that you wouldn't need to really think about everything you're going to say before you say it. Being able to correct yourself, have Siri ask better follow-up questions to better tune results, etc. would make me much more likely to use it. 
 

* I think having better NLP models will help, but also possibly utilizing ML to traing a GPT model within Siri to help her better understand the way you speak and even think through problems, so she can provice more releveant answers/follow up questions. 
 

* These technologies are making great strides in the public eye, and adding these features to an assistant built into your thousand dollar device will help the company make more, which allows for more training and research to be done on these models, allowing them to make better ones in the future. I think it's really a win-win for those involved, as the consumers get a better product, and the developers get to make a better product.
